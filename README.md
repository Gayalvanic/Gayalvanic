<!-- Level 1: Cute + Quirky bio -->

## 🎀Hi, I’m Gayathri Dadyreddy!🎀

📄 Data enthusiast | 💻 Aspiring Data Analyst | ✨ Forever curious  

📊 I love turning messy data into meaningful insights and asking *“but why?”* a little too often.  
🐍 Currently working with **Python, NumPy, SQL**, and dabbling in **AI & analytics** one project at a time.  
🌱 Learning in public, breaking code, fixing it, and learning again.

🕵️‍♀️ Actively exploring internships & real-world projects where data meets impact.  
🎶 Fun side quest: I sing, I vibe with music, and creativity keeps my brain running.

💬 Languages I speak:  
- English  
- Telugu  
- Hindi  
- (and occasionally Python 😌)

✨ This repo is my digital diary — projects, experiments, progress, and a little chaos.  
If you’re here to learn, build, or just vibe… welcome 🤍
