<!-- Level 1: Cute + Quirky bio -->

## 🎀Hi, I’m Gayathri Dadyreddy!🎀

 Data enthusiast | Aspiring Data Analyst | Forever curious  

 I love turning messy data into meaningful insights and asking *“but why?”* a little too often.  
 Currently working with **Python, NumPy, SQL**, and dabbling in **AI & analytics** one project at a time.  
 Learning in public, breaking code, fixing it, and learning again.

 Actively exploring🕵️‍♀️ internships & real-world projects where data meets impact.  
 Fun side quest: I sing, I vibe with music, and creativity keeps my brain running.

 Languages I speak:  
- English  
- Telugu  
- Hindi  
- (and occasionally Python 😌)

✨ This repo is my digital diary — projects, experiments, progress, and a little chaos.  
If you’re here to learn, build, or just vibe… welcome
